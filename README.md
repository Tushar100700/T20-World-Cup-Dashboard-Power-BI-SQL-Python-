# T20-World-Cup-Dashboard-Power-BI-SQL-Python-
🏏 T20 Cricket World Cup Data Analytics  This project provides end-to-end data analytics of the T20 Cricket World Cup, combining SQL, Python, and Power BI to create interactive dashboards. The aim is to help fans, analysts, and learners explore cricket data in a structured and visual way.

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project is inspired by the **CodeBasics YouTube channel** where I built an interactive **T20 world cup Dashboard** in Power BI to analyze and visualize business performance for a computer hardware company.

🚀 Project Workflow

Data Collection

Web scraping of match data from ESPN Cricinfo.

Raw data stored in CSV/Excel files.

Data Preprocessing

Cleaning and transformation using Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook).

Handling missing values, feature extraction (runs, wickets, strike rate, economy, etc.).

Data Modelling

SQL-style queries for filtering and aggregations.

Power Query & DAX in Power BI for calculated measures.

Visualization & Dashboard

Built in Power BI with interactive filters & slicers.

Sections include:

📊 Match results & points table

🏏 Batting & bowling statistics

🔥 Top performers (runs, wickets, strike rates, economy)

🎯 Team comparisons & head-to-head analysis

🧩 “Best XI” selector dashboard

🛠️ Tech Stack
